> A curated list of awesome real-life documentation examples 


## About

Once upon a time, I set out to find and share great examples of technical documentation over the web. But, couldn't find a single awesome community curated resouce containing great documentation examples that were categoried as per their usecases. Well, that's how this awesome list came along. Be sure to add even more documentation websites that you see all over the web. 

Each heading in the list and links below it relates a section of the documentation that is equal parts captivating, interesting and inspiring. If code for the repository is open-source, it would be linked right next to it. Below you can find, table of contents.
